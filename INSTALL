To be able to use the hardware, you should set up the correct
permissions.

The easiest way to do so is edit the
/etc/udev/rules.d/permissions.rules file (on my system it was called
40-permissions.rules).

Change these lines:

# USB devices (usbfs replacement)
SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device", MODE="0664"

into:

# USB devices (usbfs replacement)
SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0664"

Usage
-----

To run the D-Bus daemon:

$ ./daemon.py

To run the GUI:

$ ./pydget_rfid.py
