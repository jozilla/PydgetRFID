PydgetRFID README
=================

PydgetRFID [1] is a tool to interface with the Phidgets Inc. RFID kit
[2]. It wraps libphidgets [3] with ctypes [4] to communicate with the
hardware.

PydgetRFID consists of a DBUS service that allows other applications
to use the hardware through DBUS. It allows to start and stop reading,
and emits a signal whenever a new tag is read. A simple graphical user
interface (built with PyGTK) which uses this daemon is provided.

I would like to thank the people at Phidgets Inc. for making their
hardware so easily accessible and the libphidgets developers for
making a user-space driver. 

Of course, thanks go to my employer [5] for purchasing the hardware
